# The Super Tips Master Guide

Things I have realised about travelling to Japan:
People who go to Japan love talking about Japan Everyone discovers places that are completely amazing You can never go to Japan too many times.
So, with that in mind, here’s some compiled advice from fellow travellers. A lot of it is specific to Tokyo and Kyoto, some goes off the beaten track.
Up top, you’ll find a list of useful websites and resources.

This compilation guide is meant to be shared, so please feel free to send it on. If you’d like to
add your own tips after you’ve been, just email them through to me: beatrix.coles@gmail.com

Happy Japlanning,
Beatrix

## The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Tips by: Beatrix & Chris Holland
Japan Rail Passes are great as long as you’re travelling between cities more than once­ otherwise don’t bother. The transport lines are all operated by different companies and you may not be able to get to where you’re going on a JR Line (although the Yamanote line in Tokyo is super useful).

Be prepared to wait when you pick them up! If you’re getting straight into a Shinkansen, ask them to book you a seat. There’s no point in shelling out extra for green passes, the regular standards are way beyond anything on this side of the world.
The NEX is a fast but expensive way to get to and from Narita (it’s a JR Train so you should do it with a pass if you have one). Otherwise the Narita Access Bus is awesome and super cheap.

Tokyo Station is super confusing and you can get on the Shinkansen at the much easier Shinagawa. Do this if possible.
A lot of bars are super tiny (the good ones anyway) and the doors are closed. You can feel very awkward just bursting in. Get up the guts to do it and you may well be rewarded! If you’re not really welcome, you’ll feel it, so just respect this.
The 7/11 is pretty much the best thing ever. I had no idea how much I was going to love this place. Beer is sold everywhere and you’ll be tempted to walk around drinking it. We didn’t do this and I still have no idea whether it’s legal/ acceptable to do this. Quite confusing.

There are a lot of queues. Be prepared to wait for things. But by the same token, sometimes the next thing is just as good! Shop around. I got the feeling that sometimes the queue was self perpetuating...
Department stores are really fun. The basement level will probably have the most amazing food hall you’ll ever see. The top level will probably have delicious and cheap places to eat that will be pretty English­friendly. We had the best tonkatsu of the whole trip in a funny little place atop Daimaru in Kyoto.

Loft and Tokyu Hands are so much fun to shop in. They are the best place to buy zakka which is an essential thing to do in Japan.

The Nishiki Market is a must do when visiting Kyoto, and it’s wise to go hungry. While you won’t eat in the market itself (and frankly, some of the food on offer is a little challenging), the adjoining area is packed full of restaurants.
I am a sucker for a Disneyland, and will visit when it’s on offer. Tokyo Disney was worth it. We got there about 8am (for Opening Time) and left about 4pm (to avoid Rush Hour, plus we were done). The lines are next level, even for Disney. But if you’re smart about where you head, you can do quite a few rides in a day. It’s just cool to see another take on Disney, and the food is really great. We snuck in booze, because we are bad people.

We also did this in Shibuya to take photos of the scatter crossing. The women in the hotel did seem a bit worried that we might get them into trouble (the hotel is clearly over annoying foreigners with cameras) but we took a punt and it was worth it: http://wowsabi.co/the­secret­place­with­an­awesome­view­of­shibuya­crossing/
If you want WiFi, and you do because you need to use Google Maps for everything, be prepared to rent a unit or buy a data SIM. There’s little to no public WiFi. Some AirBnBs will include a pocket WiFi. We carried a spare battery pack for ours. You can rent them before you leave, we picked ours up at Narita Airport and dropped it back to the same place. Simple­ish.

‘Piss’ Alley (Tokyo)

Tips by: Ava Senaratne
SHIBUYA
Check out The Loft (goo.gl/2lW7ou) and Tokyo Hands (goo.gl/n6BsDq) ­ they're INSANE stores great for gift shopping but you can find almost anything here.
Nonbeiyokocho (http://goo.gl/yf6J4Q) is a little alley right next to the train station ­ I recommend the bar "Tight" (goo.gl/mWN2EV) ­ it's tiny but the bar tender is really friendly and so are all the patrons you find there.
HARAJUKU
Yoyogi park ­ if you just want to chill ­ check out this park on a Saturday arvo ­ it's full of all sorts of cool musical acts/people practising dance routines ­ it's very "indie tokyo"
Takoyaki ­ there's a Takoyaki shop that is AMAZING here ­ right near the station next to the big foot bridge. The store is called "Gindaco" ­ and make sure you grab some beer with it! It's a local food with mashed potato and octopus ­ it's AMAZING. (http://tokyocheapo.com/food­and­drink/gindaco­takoyaki/). Once you head out of the station, turn left at The Gap and follow the road around the corner ­ it's a tiny little shop after the corner. Design festa is a really cute cafe past Meiji­dori (Meiji Street) that hosts local artists ­ it's a really cool place for a bite/drink. (goo.gl/wG1SO8)
Takeshita Dori ­ where all Japanese cliche's come alive ­ a street chock full of crazy, colourful teenage fashion. Pay no mind to the hawkers though ­ there are a few of them that are a bit annoying ­ just walk straight past.
There's a huge temple right by the station that you can check out if you want to squeeze a bit of culture in.
OMOTESANDO
A beautiful tree­lined avenue full of designer stores. Amazing to walk through. I'd wander down as many of the small streets as you could, off the main thoroughfare. Lots of small bars, restaurants and shops.
ASAKUSA
       
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
You'll have to get here by subway ­ but it's got loads of traditional stores and a huge temple in the middle of the city.
KAMAKURA
A beautiful area out of the city with old Buddhist temples. Really chilled out and traditional and worth a trek around.
ROPPONGI
Check out the mid­town shopping mall (http://www.tokyo­midtown.com/en/)
and Roppongi hills. The Mori Art museum can be found in Roppongi Hills and usually has some awesome exhibitions (http://www.mori.art.museum/eng/)
There are tons of clubs and bars here and is the "western" area of Tokyo at night ­ a bit sleazy but if you want to meet other travellers then its the place to find them!
AGEHA (can't remember what area this is in, its close to Disney)
Ageha ­ is the biggest nightclub in Tokyo and is pretty awesome. Try and head out there on an event night ­ and be prepared to stay there until morning ­ there isn't really any other way out unless you wanted to cab all the way home which will be crazy expensive. You can catch a train there and then walk to to the club ­ or there's a shuttle from Shibuya to take you there.
SHINJUKU
Shinjuku gyoen is a massive park in the area ­ might be good if you just need some green space after all the concrete! It has a few gardens within it and is quite gorgeous. You can drink outside in Japan ­ yay ­ so cool picnic spot.
Golden Gai ­ is a network of tiny streets with tiny tiny bars (much like nonbeiyokocho) ­ all themed, a little gimicky and a little pricey but still interesting and worth having a look at. Nichiome is the gay district in Tokyo. Everyone there is super friendly ­ would totally have a wander of the bars around there.
Donkeihodai is a completely ridiculous store that sells just about anything and everything. Worth peeking in just to see all the crazy.
Robot cabaret ­ a cabaret show with robots. I missed going but my friends went and said it was insane. Worth checking out?
GINZA
Abercrombie's international flag ship store is here if you want to have a look at their enormous, nude dude painting from floor to ceiling of the store!
SHIMOKITAZAWA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimokitazawa)
This area is a little tricky to get to ­ you can get a train here from Shibuya ­ but this trainline is a little confusing because of all the express lines that run through it. Grab the Keio­Inkashina line to get there. It's full of vintage stores and cute places to eat.
Haradonuts ­ Check out this super cute donut shop! Theres a coffee shop right opposite that does REALLY good coffee ­ a rarity in Japan.
   
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
American Joe ­ this store does AWESOME vintage clothing. Tokyoites take care of their clothes so well it's like you're almost buying new stuff.
AKIHABARA
This place is mental ­ just stop by if you can and check out the crazy comic books, toys and models.
There are "maid­cafes" here you can check out. There an attraction in the area..its pretty weird and honestly I've never been, but a lot of mates have visited and say its worth the experience? Basically all the waitresses are French maids and the whole café is themed that way??
DISNEYLAND
Check out Tokyo Disneyland! Try and head to Tokyo Disney Sea ­ during the day and maybe during a weekday to get the most out of it. It is awesome and a great date spot. You can have drinks there too which is a bonus
Tips by: Steph Little
● Kyoto is honestly one of the best places I've ever been. We stayed in the area near Sanjo station ­ really excellent food places and bars all around the old town area
● If you love gyoza you must go to Chao Chao
● Stay on that street and wander down all of the laneways, there are loads of excellent
bars behind all of the tiny doors, some of which look out over the river which is cool
● Look out for this firefly sign for a tiny but cool bar called Tanbo
● Nijo Castle and Imperial Palace in Kyoto both worth a look
● Take the train out to Arashiyama and just wander around the bamboo forest and
surrounds
● All of the suburbs in Tokyo have something to offer but we spent most of our time in
Shibuya (stayed at the Granbell), Nakameguro, Shinjuku, Omote­sando (amazing coffee
and best tonkatsu) and Shimokitazawa
● Go to Sega Joyopolis for next level gaming, arcades and crazy photo booths ­ fun for
people watching if you don't want to play
● Go to a rabbit cafe for sheer weirdness
● There's a cool store called Village Vanguard in Shimokitazawa which is excellent for
weird gifts like cat sushi key rings and the like
We also went out to Kanazawa but I wouldn't recommend that unless you have lots of spare time. Not a must­see.
If you're travelling around a bit, get a JR pass (japan rail) and pick it up at the travel agent when you land at the airport. Some metro lines are covered with this pass and all long distance trains
     
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
are including shinkansen ­ definitely do a trip on a bullet train and pick up an amazing bento box at the station to take onboard.
Tips by: Hitomi Okada
If you like whiskies (whiskeys?), I recommend you to try authentic bars in Ginza, even though it costs Y1000~ for seating & 1500~ for a drink, as many of the bartenders in Ginza have won at international competitions. Not sure if they are open for the year end, so you might like to check before you go.

I like Bar Samboa Ginza too. They have English website:

Tips by: Brent Nicholas
Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto.There are 100's of historic Temples Shrines etc all in easy walking distance of the central city.It is a great city to walk around.There are also 1000's of great Restaurants sake Bars Whiskey Bars & Geisha houses in Pontocho & Geon (central city.)

 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Ueno Park stroll ideally on a Saturday
Go up one of the tall buildings in Tokyo during the day AND at night ­The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings are free.
Tsukiji for early morning auction then sushi (you need to be there at 4am or some shit, we went drunk. Was amazing)
Shinjuku Gyoen (Shinjuku National Gardens)
Hachiko cross­roads Friday night, Shibuya. Mental who are all these people moment.
Drinks on Centre Gai, Shibuya on Friday or Saturday. Try to buy a bottle. I much preferred this to Golden Gai.
Visit Ginza especially Sony Building
Visit Akihabara Electric Town, look at crazy shit and find a maid cafe
Go to Asagi (6 seated Michelin starred tempura near Ginza)
Go to Maisen (Tonkatsu chain, the best. Go to the one in Aoyama)
Apart from just wandering round that's what I liked the most
Oh and def all the cute streets near the temples in Asakusa
Oh!
And the all you can eat and drink Monjayaki island!
Tips by: Shuchi Kothari
Please close your eyes and spend the money it takes to spend one night at Matsui Honkan ryokan in Kyoto. Sign up for dinner and breakfast too. It will transform your life.
In Tokyo ­ go to the Abura Soba branch in Ginza. There are AS branches all over Tokyo but the Ginza branch has the best fresh ramen. Try yuzu paste in your ramen bowl.
If interested in buying gourmet food, go to Akomeya food shop in Ginza. I regularly drop a couple of hundred dollars there!
Go to Tokyu hands in shibuya ­ all other Tokyo branches are too small.
In Kyoto, bang across Matsui Honkan ryokan is the best paper shop. In Tokyo, kukyudo is the best paper shop/ also in Ginza
Kujo­ oldest incense shop in Tokyo is in Ginza in Ginza Core building ­ Kyoto too has gorgeous incense shops
Go to Sou Sou for every cool Kyoto made clothes ­ Kyoto shop is walking distance from the ryokan
Nishi market is 7 mins walk from the Matsui Honkan ryokan in Kyoto ­­ you will go crazy at Nishi market ­ spend hours browsing eating loving
Buy studio ghibli museum tix. If sold out, buy from lawsons supermarkets daily quota...
Go to kabukicho (golden gai) in East shinjuku.
  
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Tips by: Hannah Frankish
A general rule: wherever you go, if you see a good looking Okonomiyaki restaurant with ice cold draft beer, you MUST stop here.
KYOTO:
*Ponto­cho alley for amazing bars & restaurants (the ones facing out onto the river are amazing but more pricey, but def worth it once)
*Gion district for incredible restaurants (best to stray off the main drag into the side lanes for less expensive and better quality ones)
*The Philosopher's Walk (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Walk) is a must do...definitely check out the Silver Pavilion (Ginkaku­ji) and the surrounding gardens which are at the beginning/end of this walk depending on which end you start.
*Heian Jingu shrine (where my father got married) is amazing and the gardens are immaculate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_Shrine)
*Train to Nara to check out some of their temples (this is the awesome place with all the deer roaming around that you can feed) ­ ONLY IF YOU HAVE SPARE TIME...DEF TAKES A FULL DAY...but would def recommend if you do.
TOKYO:
*We stayed at Dormy Inn Hatchobori, which is close to the city and an easy train ride anywhere. They have really great baths, but we mostly stayed here because we got a mad deal on the agoda website...so maybe just check out what's going on there.
*Harajuku rules whether you're stalking the mentalist Little Bow Peep Harajuku girls or for shopping/eating.
*Shinjuku is good for a night out...busiest train/metro station in the world, so be prepared...neon light craziness, with heaps of great Shabu Shabu restaurants in the sky scrapers.
*Ginza is alright if you want to do some high end shopping...we only went to window shop and see how ridiculous the displays were in Gucci/Hermes/Armani etc
*The Peter, Bjorn & John video for Nothing to Worry About was how we imagined our Tokyo visit would be. And it was. Peter Bjorn and John ­ Nothing to Worry About
*The hotel bar in Lost in Translation is the Park Hyatt Tokyo (Shinjuku) it's uber expensive but you might consider a pilgrimage. http://www.tokyo.park.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index
HELPFUL PHRASES:
Frank & I were armed with approx 5 phrases/words that helped us, so although limited here they are:
Ohayo Gozaimus = Very good morning to you Konichiwa = Good day
Konbanwa = Good evening
Oishi = delicious
Kawaii = cute
    
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Arigato = thank you
Arigato Gozaimus = thank you very much
DOMO ARIGATO GOZAIMUS = THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH (Mad Thanks...we used this when we had lost our passports and the japan rail staff member returned them) Mamachari = mama's chariot = those old school crappy bikes that everyone is riding in Kyoto...actually on that note beware as they ride them bloody fast and only give pedestrian's a few bell rings notice to get out of their path...may be worth hiring them if it's not too cold!?!
Tips by: Anna Jackson & David Straight
Nezu Museum in Minami Aoyama http://www.nezu­muse.or.jp/en/
Beautiful modernist museum and traditional gardens. You won't believe you're in the middle of Tokyo. Good place to come to experience a tea ceremony if you're so inclined. They have a traditional tea house and also a modern cafe.
Nozy Coffee in Setagaya is very cute but there's another one in harajuku
http://www.nozycoffee.jp/
St Mary's Cathedral is a must for architectural enthusiasts & lovers of concrete
http://www.archdaily.com/114435/ad­classics­st­mary­cathedral­kenzo­tange
The JR Tokyo Wide pass will allow you to travel very far for very little over 3 days. You can go as far north as Gala Yuzawa station in Niigata which is home to Ponshukan Sake Heaven http://en.japantravel.com/niigata/ponshukan­sake­heaven­at­echigo­yuzawa­station/655
It's worth going just for the sake museum/tasting room, but you could also experience some great skiing/snowboarding or visit onsens in Niigata or Gunma. The pass will also allow you to visit tourist spots such as kamakura or Mt Fuji.
Someone please visit Trouble Peach in Shimokitazawa and bring back David's iconic red hat, which he lost there and still misses very much.
Our AirBNB in Shimokitazawa was great. Nice quiet neighbourhood, but close to Shinjuku & Shibuya. Shimo is getting quite hipster­touristy but still has a lot of charm. https://www.airbnb.co.nz/rooms/4326251
Re. Onsen: naked public bathing (sure you know that) no tattoos. You would probably have to do some hunting for private onsens. The no tattoos is pretty much a blanket thing. Tattoos + yakuza. You may find places that cater to foreigners that are more flexible, like this place http://www.kashiwaya.org/e/magazine/onsen/tattoos.html but that will take a bit of research.
        
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Tips by: Shelley Dresden & Robert Potter
SHOPPING AND PLACES
Here are the places we strolled around – I had so many blisters after the trip, just when you think you really know your most trusty pair of running shoes :(
Shimokitazawa – really cool, chilled out area with super cute shops. Very “hip.” Buttloads of vintage stores especially...
Ginza – high end, businessy and department store­y. The Shiseido Parlour is really worth a look, total throwback to 60s/70’s glam. No actual make up, just a biscuit / cake shop and a restaurant and an art gallery. Rob and I both bought Japanese butter cookie tins for our mums – a really good gift actually!
Aoyama – super cool and understated, a real "clean living" vibe. I think this is where the Blue Note Café is, but that's quite the special occasion night out.
Ebisu – really businessy but ace to get amongst the izakaya bars at night! Think this is close to Tokyo city proper which is a bit boring. The Marunouchi buildings are quite beautiful but other than that we didn't spend much time in Tokyo city. But I think that is where the Imperial Palace is?
Harajuku – of course! It used to be on a Sunday that the Harajuku girls would all get dressed up and hang around Yoyogi Park. It’s not really like that now but you will still see some wild fashions. We didn’t get round to Yoyogi Park but it’s meant to be lovely!
Harajuku runs into Omotesando which is a lot more chic (and home to the beautiful Omotesando Koffee). Try and go down every damn alleyway you can. There are lots of really insane shops in Harajuku and Omotesando ­ 6% Dokidoki, The Cute Cube, Kiddyland, lots of excellent brands reppin' with some amazing store setups including Opening Ceremony, Stussy, Supreme, APC and Acne. Laforet department store is pretty wild too.
Shibuya – we Airbnb­d here for both parts of our “Tokyo time”. Not sure if your accom is already booked, but I really recommend this as your home base. Some freaking awesome shops, and there is so much activity, all hours of the day. It’s so much fun. Tetsuya Book Store is a must. Tower Records not quite as good, but OK. Tokyu Hands is a must see, Shibuya 109 and Parco Buildings are great for some wild kawaii shopping too. A lot of the stuff for ladies is a bit like “yeah I will never wear that” but you may surprise yourself and take home a few extreme fashion treats! I suspect you may be, like me, a Tsumori Chisato fan, so check that out in the Parco building. Take your passport everywhere for potential discounts.
PS Sneaks are NOT cheaper in Japan. Forget that notion.

 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
The Mori Art Museum in Roppongi is great, we saw the Takashi Murakami exhibition there and hopefully you may be able to catch it too! This is also in the same building as the Tokyo City View which is AWESOME but do it at night in case you get smogged out during the day.
I see that you said the Ghibli Museum is closed when you are there... well just FYI I tried to get tickets and was told you have to buy about 3 months in advance. A bitter, bitter lesson.
Just FYI we didn’t go to the Robot Restaurant. YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO IT, DON’T LET ANYONE MAKE YOU.
Electric City is OK but really not essential. Pretty boring actually.
FOOD AND DRINK
Save lots of money by breakfasting at Lawsons / Family Mart / 7­11... coffee in a can and a pastry / egg sandwich. The cheapest eats in Japan! I have no doubt you will be doing your extensive coffee research before you go, so you may be like me – preserve your teeth and get a real coffee where you can!
Another good idea is to go to Tokyo Foodshow – underground near Shibuya station. A huge gourmet supermarkets with every food imaginable to take home and enjoy. Check out the $15 rockmelons too...
A traditional drip coffee experience is Hoshino Coffee plus the 4cm high pancakes they sell there. They are all around Tokyo, there is one in Shibuya 109 Men’s as a start.
Go to Itasoba Kaoriya in Ebisu for lunch. Incredible soba noodles with a variety of dipping sauces or soups or tempura. Try the “trial noodle” as in, trying for the first time: cold noodles with a s=creamy sesame dipping sauce and a soy dipping sauce. They give you roasted rice tea and a soup to mix in your dipping sauce at the end of the meal, then you drink it up! You will feel super virtuous and wholesome and I am pretty sure it will 100% cancel out all the fried crap you will inevitably end up eating on a night out...
Butagami is a serious spot for tonkatsu – as a Jewish Person I did not sample this but Rob did. It is quite legendary! This was in Roppongi Hills, a fancy shmance area with some very cool bars ­ not to be confused with Roppongi which is a bit more rough 'n' ready.
If you or a friend is vegan/vegetarian inclined, there is a vegan ramen place in Tokyo Station called Ten’s Tan Tan. OMG. I went there twice. (This is the only guaranteed vegetarian place I went to. If any travellers are vegetarian they really need to cross ramen off their list.)
Kagaya is really worth a visit, in Minato. Do NOT go by yourself – not a safety note or anything, it will just be very, verrrrrry weird if you are there on your own. Advise a couple drinks

 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
beforehand too (if you are drinking inclined). Don’t order a big meal as the food isn’t great – it’s an experience. Try not to Google it before you go... and you have to call and make a reservation beforehand.
On a related note, please be sure to go have a drink at Ishinohana in Shibuya. The cocktails will knock all your proverbial socks off and your real ones.
Drunkards Alley in Shibuya is craaaazy – just two streets worth of teeny tiny bars that only seat 2­5 people max, rows of them all piled on top of each other. People like to DRINK UP in Japan as you will see! You will have a table charge in pretty much every bar which is on average about 500 yen.
There is a similar section of bars in Shinjuku which is even cooler than Drunkard’s Alley, and you can try find La Jetee – a little bar where famous filmies are said to frequent. We couldn’t find it so let me know how you go!
We didn’t go to the Fish Market but I hear that is quite the experience! You have to go very early though to see any market biz happening. I read that a tuna auction is a real sight to behold but that is a4am activity.
Otherwise – go and explore because let’s face it pretty much every damn thing you stick in your mouth will be unbelievable and life changing. You could try 5new izakaya bars each night and never make it through them all!
A tip: for all other “special” or famous sushi / tempura / sukiyaki spots you wanna hit – try and go at lunch. Lunch sets are miles cheaper than dinners.
AREAS
Daikanyama ­ this is a super cool area that like Aoyama, is so damn stylish. More great shopping... expensive though.
Meguro ­ another area that is really coming up, a bit hipster. There is a Monocle­recommended French bistro called beard there... we were contemplating a visit but we got lost as I thought it was in Naka­meguro. Don't make that mistake, Naka­meguro is boring!
Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum ­ this is an art museum inside a royal residence. The house was incredibly beautiful, and it has a garden you can sit in and enjoy the sun afterward. The actual exhibition didn't interest me as much, but there is a permanent exhibit of various robe pins ­ I think thats what they were ­ that had been gifted to the Prince. A few were just quite traditional looking, but there are some really interesting ones. The utter whimsy of some will make you smile.

 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
I don't feel like I emphasised how much fun Shimokitazawa is. Am sure others have said the same, go go go!
Meiji Shrine ­ you'll for sure end up going here, it is wonderful.
The Tokyo Natural History Museum is great ­ but then, I visit natural history museums in nearly every city I go around the world, so a bias there.
EATS
I think you will have much more luck exploring and finding good eats, as you aren't restricted by pork or shellfish. I am positive I unwittingly consumed 1kg of each while I was away, despite my best efforts! But three more recommendations I had to share:
Maisen ­ a chain of tonkatsu restaurants which rank among the good 'uns in Japan. We went there and Rob enjoyed it very much.
Viron ­ a French bakery in Shibuya where you can order an incredibly huge basket of pastries for breakfast. You may actually expire after eating there, just a warning.
Napolimania ­ on the off chance you need a break from incredible, amazing Japanese food, this place is the shit! Officially Aoyama, but it's pretty much on the outskirts of Shibuya.
A fruit and cream sandwich ­ sounds weird, but it works. Keep an eye out for them in some of the incredible foodcourts you will visit.
Here are the only "tips" I have from Kyoto ­ very few, very unoriginal... nothing ground breaking here, but can't resist to blather on one more time about Japan!
Things to do:
Souvenir shop ­ Kyoto is where it's at for traditional Japanese souvenirs, if you are looking for gifts. They love the shit out of matcha tea there, everything will be green :)
Ponto­cho is a long street full of restaurants, all lit with lanterns at night. Lots of tourists about. It's a gorgeous street to wander up and down, there is some sort of canal running alongside it too, so it is
Gion, the very traditional / historical area of Kyoto. This is street upon street of wooden doors and lanterns. It is very quiet during the day so better to go at night. As I recall, we went on a very quiet night ­ even if there isn't a lot happening, it's worth strolling around just to soak up the atmosphere alone.

 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
All the doors were closed but there were people in every establishment ­ Rob and I were totally speculating that there had to be a million sordid things happening behind each door but really it's just people having dinner and a few drinks.
Gion is the most likely place to spot a geisha or at least, a young geisha­in­training hurrying from one engagement to another. I don't think they are seen on the street all that much, but we did see two that night. I read somewhere that it is bad manners to snap a photo but lots of people were doing it, so...
Arashiyama is a lovely spot – the bamboo grove is just exceptional and it’s a nice little place to walk too.
Philosopher's Walk ­ when you are "templed out", which is a common ailment that befalls Kyoto visitors, this is a nice walk to just zone out and chill
Golden Pavilion ­ name says it all :)
Inari Shrine – will be the good part of a day... beautiful temple site and rows upon rows of bright orange tori. It is quite the walk so wear some comfy shoes. And naturally you will have to sample some inarizushi which is the local thang. Tofu is a very cherished foodstuff in Kyoto and you will find a lot of places pumping out the inari and the kitsune udon among other things.
I haven’t really included other temples because you will see so many in Kyoto ­ there are loads to keep you busy every day!
Len ­ a luxe hostel which has a great cafe. Coffee, mini pain au chocolat and mini baguettes which were tiny and utterly perfect. It is the hostel breakfast area so you just plonk as many as you want on a plate and pay at the the till. Coffee nice but be warned, tends to the weak side. They were a bit perplexed by us asking for stronger...
(We actually thought this would have been a nice place to stay, better than our Airbnb)

Hiroshima
I used to live in Hiroshima and its a beautiful city!
You should check out Okonomiyaki­mura downtown which is a tall building filled with Okonomiyaki restaurants making the dish in the Hiroshima­style.
The Peace Park and museum is a sobering place, but it is interesting and lovely to walk through. The top spot is Miyajima (the floating shrine)...try and time it with high tide to get the best effect. The tram takes a while to get out there but the train is faster...careful of the deer, too!
 
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Try some of the momiji­manju (maple leaf cake) when you are there...its a famous food for Hiroshima and this shrine. I love the bean filled ones but the custard (they call it cream) is also delicious!
Tokyo
I always took people to Shibuya (which has the big crossing that you always see on movies/TV) Look for Hachiko’s Statue or exit to get to it.
Harajuku of course is interesting and there are lots of great shops in that area.
Just behind the Harajuku station is Meiji Shrine. Its a nice walk through the park and it was built to commemorate Emperor Meiji. This shrine is also used for a lot of weddings.
Shopping on Cat Street is great ­ In Shinjuku and across the main road from Omotesando Hills.
Just down the road is Aoyama and is interesting to walk through...this is one of the most stylish and affluent areas in Japan for shopping and living.
If the weather is good, head up to ‘Tochou' (the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings) and go to the observatory http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/TMG/observat.htm
Its free to enter and you can get an amazing view...also great at night!
At any of the big department stores, head down to the basement floor and check out the 'depa­chika'. Its where they have the best food from around the country on display. Its all really beautiful as it’s designed to give as gifts and you can often sample many of the items. Often within train stations they also have these places. Daimaru Department Store attached to Tokyo Station is apparently a good one.
The Loft and Tokyu Hands are also a cool department stores filled with interesting things for your life and home! ...fun to wander through :)
Uniqlo and Muji are also must sees.
Bic Camera is good for electronics as well.
I really love Asakusa area as well...its quite an old area and there are a lot of traditional artisans working in that area. There are also a lots of stores selling cookware and utensils (kanamono­ya) not far from here...a little too easy to spend all your money!
The Asakusa Shrine is also fun to walk through and there are good sembei crackers and other treats like dango (pounded sticky rice balls) around here too!
Osaka
Osaka is fun and different from Tokyo. Livelier! You can head across the Dotombori Bridge at night and you should try some octopus balls (takoyaki) as well ...famous food this area.
You should also try Okonomiyaki Osaka style. Both cities are very proud of their versions! :) The Osaka castle isn’t an original but interesting to see.
You could also check out a baseball game if any are on. Actually in any of the cities...The Hanshin Tigers are a top team in that area (actually from the Hyogo Prefecture) Loud and lots of fun!
America Village (Amerika­mura) is also fun to go through!

Kyoto
is amazing everywhere you go and much more traditional and old world japan than the big cities. Any shrine or temple you go to will be lovely, but some of the top spots for me are Kiyomizudera, Kinkakuji, Sanjyusangendo, ryuanji etc just wandering around is often a lovely thing and you can find really interesting shops and parks wherever you go.
Dont forget to look up when you are in the city as there are lots of restaurants etc upstairs where you least expect and the convenience stores are always awesome for snacks for the trains. So many good drinks and bento boxes.
When we travel, we often stay at the Toyoko Inn as its clean and cheap. If you are non­smokers, ask for a non­smoking room as well.http://www.toyoko­inn.com/eng/
They are throughout Japan and are simple, but usually very conveniently located.
Coffee
For filter coffee, you also want to want to try and find ‘kisaten'. This is a old style coffee shop where they make pour over coffee with single origins rather than espresso.
You are usually still allowed to smoke inside them, so they can get a bit stinky if you don’t like smoke! Some coffee will benefit from the cream they serve with it as it can be a bit dark.
But you will find interesting coffees and they are usually small and interesting styles!
Espresso isn’t as common but there are some gems around, you just have to search them out. One of the best places that I went when I was last in Tokyo was Horiguchi Coffee. Its a bit out of the way, but it was a lovely experience. He only makes coffee using the cloth filter style as well which is cool http://www.kohikobo.co.jp/en/
Fuglen coffee is great in Shibuya. They turn into a cocktail lounge in the evenings as well.
Of course, there is also Maruyama Coffee...the company where the previous World Barista works! I visited their Nishi Azabu store...its beautiful and the coffee was outstanding! (The Tokyo stores are at the bottom of the page and the Nishi Azabu store is the first one...with the picture inside the store) http://www.maruyamacoffee.com/blog/shop/
Nozy Coffee ­on Cat St ­ they are really good http://www.nozycoffee.jp/access/index.html And Streamer for the king of Latte Art, Hiroshi Sawada http://streamercoffee.com/location
I visited the Shibuya site and had a camouflage donut too!
Blue Bottle has just opened in Tokyo as well... https://bluebottlecoffee.com/cafes/kiyosumi
Harajuku and Shinjuku are great and there are lots of great shops in that area....I’m not sure what you want to see but BAPE stores, Muji, ABC Marts (sneakers), Supreme etc are all in this area.
Just behind the Harajuku train station is Meiji Shrine. Its a nice walk through the park and it was built to commemorate Emperor Meiji. This shrine is also used for a lot of weddings so you sometimes can see this happening as well.

FOOD!
‘Beard' restaurant in Tokyo is awesome. We did the set menu and the food and wine was wonderful! The owner, Shin, lived in Montreal for a few years and also the States and perhaps some time in Europe (Paris maybe?) He speaks perfect English and is worth a visit! It only seats about 12 people so definitely book ahead of time! http://www.kinfolk.com/city_guide/tokyo­beard/
My friend went to an Eel restaurant called Ichinoya in Nishi­azabu and had a 7 course Eel meal. She said is was amazing!
On my last trip I was taken to this lovely Soba restaurant called Sarashina in Azabu. They hand make the noodles there and you can watch them in the front window! http://www.sarashina­honten.com/map/index.html
Also, this is a country that builds up so don’t forget to look up and there are usually lots of great restaurants and bars up on higher floors.
Tips by: Olivier Michelet
So as a general rule, getting lost in the street is just very pleasant in Tokyo so feel free to just go with the flow. It’s all the more easy to get lost because there are no street names. Almost impossible to find places. Your best bet is to use google maps, it saved my life many times.
You should be able to find the locations of the places below on google maps. Between brackets I put the name of the area the places are located in.
So here are a few spots that I particularly enjoyed, my “Top 5” if you will. ­ Good Beer Faucets (Shibuya)
Amazing beer selection curated by Dede, an Israeli guy. He was super friendly. He showed us the Tofu restaurant and even made a booking for us. He speaks fluent Japanese. If you go there, tell them Oli and Stef sent you. Perfect to start off your evening before going to dinner and party like a mad man in Shibuya.
­ Kicks Lab (Harajuku)
Not sure if you’re into sneakers. I am, and this is a fucking crazy store with 2 floors full of limited edition Nikes and stuff. The boss is really friendly and helpful. He gave me a VIP card: 10% off on everything in the shop. I can pass it to you if you want!
­ Tofu Cuisine Sorano (Shibuya)
That’s the one, just fucking go there. It’s along the train tracks near Shibuya station. Not very easy to find, here’s the exact address and phone number. Get someone to book for you and show you where it is.
    
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Sakuragaoka 4­17 Shibuya­ku, Tokyo 150­0031 Japan TEL 03­5728­5191
­ Goruden Gai http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Golden_Gai
­ Cat Cafe
There are several cat cafes in Tokyo. If you wanna spend a couple of hours surrounded with 50 cats while drinking your coffee and have a surreal experience, go to one. I went to one in Shinjuku, at the 6th floor of a building. Google it you should find it easily.
Tips by: Dane Cody
­ Cycling is a great way to get around in Japan, cheap way to see the cities and you'll witness sights and sounds you wouldn't usually. Kyoto is incredible by bike, helps you to get away from the "lonely planet set". Osaka equally as awe­inspiring, riding around the streets and back alleys at night is like being in a blade runner­esque dystopia (at least visually).
­ staying in a Ryokan and visiting an Onsen is a must. Go for the most trad possible. Be aware you won't get into most Onsen's if you have visible tattoos (most Kiwis and Australians?)
­ Tsukiji Fish Market, get there for the tuna auctions ­ wow! Also a great spot for sashimi ­ straight off the boats and fresh AF.
­ 2nd hand / bargain shopping ­ head out off the CBDs in most cities and into the urban sprawl and you can find many second hand shops where you'll find precious trinkets to attach cherished memories to. I've got a Sake delivery bag I still use for shopping that is made out of durable canvas that I love and cherish more than most other possessions ­ reminds me of riding a whip around Kyoto in the hot sun, drinking malt beer from a vending machine.

Just got back from my 3rd trip to Tokyo. Each time I find a unique bar. Try King Biscuit. Arata is a legend. Plus he plays harmonica.

Tokyo recommendations
We stayed at the Claska. It’s a great little boutique hotel. Very cool and not so expensive. You can hire motorized bicycles for free and jaunt up and down the street and have a look at all the vintage furniture/décor shops and restaurants. 1 stop from Shibuya in Meguro so very close to all the action.
http://claska.com/en/hotel/
For one of the best Tonkatsu restaurants nearby definitiely go to Tonki and order the Pork Fillet Tonkatsu http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review­g1066450­d1677865­Reviews­Tonki­Meguro _Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html
Otherwise anywhere around Shibuya, Harajuku, Aoyama and Shinjuku are some of my fave areas to stay in.
Must do’s: Check out all the wacky fashion in Harajuku and then walk up the main street in Omote Sando (round the corner from Harajuku). It’s the Champs Elysees of Tokyo. Gorgeous stores and they close off the street on the weekend for Rock & Roll dancing. The Dior and Prada concept stores are architectural marvels.
I love checking out the foodcourts of major department stores. They have lots of samples on offer so you can taste a wide selection of food before buying. In summer most of the department stores open Beer gardens at the top floor. A must to go to one in Shinjuku (Isetan or Keio department stores)
For something very ritzy with a view I would go to the New York Bar ­ 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku. Incredible views, watch the sunset. Very expensive drinks!
Go to www.worldsbestbars.com/japan/tokyo to do some research on cool bars in the city. For the latest gadgets and electronics go to Akihabara
Kyoto recommendations
Kokedera is the moss garden temple that you have to write to to be invited. It was one of the best experiences and not many people do it because they aren’t organised in advance. Go here for instructions http://www.japan­guide.com/e/e3937.html
Other temples to go to in Kyoto would be: Kiyomizudera which is gorgeous and set up on a hill.
     
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Fushimi inari tori gates http://www.japan­guide.com/e/e3915.html is a great hike through never ending red tori gates. Incredible!
The bamboo groves in Arashiyama are magnificent http://www.japan­guide.com/e/e3912.html#bamboo
Stay in a ryokan (Japanese style accommodation). It’s a unique experience but can be expensive. They offer what’s called a ‘Kaiseki’ which is a traditional Japanese multi­course meal, much like a degustation. Ingredients are usually locally sourced and presented beautifully. Here's a good site to find one that fits your budget http://selected­ryokan.com/ryokan/location/kyoto­yunohana­hot­spring
Other areas to consider
Naoshima is a group of islands with art scattered throughout. Although I haven’t stayed here, a friend has and says it's amazing http://benesse­artsite.jp/en/
Eating
Try unagi – eel. Delicious!
If you are up for a challenge Blowfish or Fugu is a unique experience. I went to

TOKYO LIST
NEIGHBOURHOODS:
For a more chilled out Airbnb experience try these neighborhoods. More grungy, fun, local, little bars, music, less tourists
­ Nakano
­ Shimokitazawa
­ Nakamegoro
BARS:
'Golden Gai' in Shibuya. Worth it for the very unique experience. The bars cover a whole block. A labyrinth of tiny themed bars that may only hold five to ten people. The area can be described as a bit rough but still very safe. Just many unusual characters about. Also, don't just barge into a bar. Make eye contact with the bar person and ask if it's ok, they'll give you some indication whether you're welcome. You'll have to pay around a $10 host fee, on top of the drinks.
Clubs: Womb (umu in Japanese) and Le Baron de Paris. Womb is a superclub. I think Aoyama Tunnel is supposed to be good too.
      
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
EXPERIENCES:
­ Nakano Broadway. One of my favourite places in Tokyo. It's a shabby, run down mall in Nakano. The top four stories are where all the 'otaku' buy their figurines and manga and collectables and creepy stuff. Pokey little stores. Wierd customers. Nakano is also a great neighbourhood. More run down where all the musicians and artists live. Little grungy dive bars and venues. Fun at night. Not many tourists.
­ 'Department H' is a monthly fetish party run by drag queens. Stage shows are involved. Tickets are about $50 AU. You can turn up and buy them on the door. It's wierdly BYO too. You can see all the extreme Japanese subcultures on show here. Bagelhead demonstrations. Big Japanese babies. Latex dogs. Dress up is encouraged but if you look a bit outside the norm anyway you'll be ok.
­ Robot wars at the Shinjuku Robot Restaurant! In Shibuya. Simply very surreal and bizarre. A little touristy but an incomparable experience. I'd put it on the must­do list.
­ Akihabara, known as Electronics Town. It’s pretty manic, streets packed with mostly men and shops selling computers and cameras, retro arcades, and 'maid’ cafes where you’re served by girls in costume. One highlight was 'Super Potato' (vintage arcade games).
­ Harajuku park is cool to walk through. It's also where all the Harajuku girls and rockabilly boys hang out on Sunday and practise their dance moves (in Harajuku Park).
­ Nakamegoro is where everyone says is nice to hang out. And Shimokitazawa is great too.
­ It's also pretty fun to visit a cat cafe in Shibuya. Can be depressing though if it's a bad one.
­ Odaiba ­ weird man made island that has huge convention centres and bizarre public sculpture. Going to a random pop culture convention is a pretty cool experience.
FOOD:
Best authentic, local experiences ­ eat at local Izakayas or Yakitoris
­ Izakayas I'd describe as the Japanese version of a pub. You'd need to ask a local to recommend one in the neighbourhood. They have noisy good atmosphere and huge menus of share dishes. You'll only find Japanese eating in them but they usually have an English menu if you ask.
­ Yakatoris are small restaurants that grill different meats and foods to order and serve them on skewers. Again, great atmosphere and sometimes very strange foods on offer.
SHOPPING:
­ Aoyama and Omotosando are neighbouring areas and good for both galleries and shopping. The main boulevard of Omotosando has many Flagship designer stores and is interesting to just walk down. Harajuku is down the end of the boulevard and where all the freak fashion kids hang out. Good people watching.
http://www.japan­talk.com/jt/new/omotesando
­ Some of the top fashion houses (Prada, Louis Vuitton) in Omotosando have galleries on their top floors with big name international shows. No one visits them and it feels weird to even walk into the stores but just head to the elevators and it's ok.
­ Tokyo Hands ­ worth a visit for the gadgets. Huge multi level 'everything' chain store
 
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
­ Art Museums worth visiting: Mori Art Museum, Scai the Bathhouse, Xyz collective are the best artist run space. Otherwise pretty 'meh' on the whole.
GALLERIES:
Tokyo Wonder Site ­ Where I did my residency. Daisuku would be a good contact to give you tips of show you around. Very good English. Nice guy.
Tokyo Wonder Site
Cosmos Aoyama South 3F, 5­53­67
Jingumae, Shibuya­Ku, Tokyo 150­0001

Daisuke Harada <harada@tokyo­ws.org>
XYZ collective. The most interesting 'artist run' space in Tokyo (there's not many!). They do commercial stuff too though. COBRA is the best contact there. He has spent time in Melbourne at the Gertrude St residency. His english is not very good but he is super friendly and will take you around.
http://xyzcollective.org/
Misako and Rosen. Hipster commercial gallery. Tricky to get to (most are!). They do lots of Art Fairs and things. The guy that runs it is American and can probably point you in lots of directions.
http://www.misakoandrosen.com/en/
Nanzuka Gallery ­ saw a great exhibtion by Keiichi Tanaami here (early collage and drawing work from the 70's). Hard to find so study the map!
http://nug.jp/en/top/
Talion Gallery ­ Went to one of their first exhibitions (COBRA's from XYZ collective)
http://taliongallery.com/en/index.html
REST OF JAPAN:
the onsen town in Nagano is amazing, and so is Naoshima. If you go to Naoshima it's worth visiting the smaller islands nearby too. 'Teshima House Museum' on Teshima island was a highlight for me. There's also a cat island that I didn't go to.
Tips by: Michael Jordan
GOING OUT
*DO NOT miss going to JBS bar in Shibuya. It’s the one owned by the old b­boy who has like 14 000 records in there. Dope hangout and all drinks are 500 yen.
*Thursday night check out Harlem in Shibuya – pretty much best hip hop night in Tokyo
      
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
*Sunday Night check out Tokyo Social Club in Shibuya. Basement club with hip hop / RnB.. Crazy vibes.
*most of the bigger / world class clubs are shit. Super expensive to get in, expensive drinks and play trance / EDM. So unless there is an international on, Womb, Ageha, Sound Museum aren’t really worth checking, Vision from memory was pretty good though.
*Roppongi is kinda seedy where local girls hang to pick up foreigners.. Would give it a miss unless you are into that sort of thing.
*Worth spending a few hours in Golden Gae in Shinjulku.. Basically one big block with a bunch of laneways with tiny bars that seat 6­14 people..
FOODS and DRANKS
*Download an app called GURUNAVI. You can search basically every restaurant by price, cuisine, English menu or not, nomihodai etc..
*When eating out at a izakaya look for ones (or ask) if they have ‘nomihodai’ which is literally all you can drink (tabehodai is all you can eat). For a set price for either 90 mins or two hours you can go nuts.. But have to finish drink first before you can get another one, and range is limited. *Ramen – Menya Musashi (Shinjuku) but seriously any ramen place will be pretty good
*Gyoza – Gyoza Lou in Harajuku (good fun trying to find this place...cheap and cheerful)
*Sushi – Uogashi Nihonichi Standing Sushi Bar Dogenzaka Shibuya (quick,cheap & delicious) – try the yaki salmon mayo sushi
*Steak – Ukai­tei (Omotesando) – expensive but amazing place to eat and great view.
*Drink a beer or coffee at the top floor bar of the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku (amazing view of Tokyo) Lost in Translation!
*Rooftop gardens of dept stores in Ikeburro – good for beers, and just chilling out after shopping – also Lumine & Keio Sky Garden have bars on their rooftop.
*Buri in Ebisu (standing sake bar – ask for the frozen sake “Kokken”) ­ insane choice of sake & awesome staff
*35 Steps bistro Izakaya in Shibuya – amazing food & awesome vibe every night
*Miami Gardens & Miami Villa – only go here when you are trashed after a night out as they close around 10am in Shibuya near the station...great place to meet randoms who are trashed and missed the last train home
*Kichijoji – my favourite suburb – take the train and spend a day here...food, records, K­Skit sneakers...awesome place
*Shouhachi (tonkatsu), Café Rigoletto & La Befana (Italian), Musashiya (ramen), Tanaka­tei (bakery), Iseya Sohonten (yakitori) – all in Kichijoji
SNEAKER SHOPPING
*Atmos (4­32­8 Jingumae – Shibuya­ku)
*Undefeated ­ Harajuku
*Kicks Lab – Harajuku (this place is expensive but fricken INSANE) *Nike Harajuku (near Harajuku station)
*Adidas – Shibuya (near Shibuya station)
*K­skit (Kichijoji) – all original OG sneakers – check their website

 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
CLOTHES SHOPPING:
*Dover St Market (Ginza)
*Paul Smith (Jingumae on Omotosando)
*Isetan dept store
*Comme Des Garcons (Aoyoma)
*Shibuya has plenty of stores as does Daikenyama & Ebisu with great shopping for guys *Roppongi Hills dept store (lot of quality shopping & cute girls at the Starbucks)

*Shimokitazawa is awesome and very much like Brunswick....great shopping and bars and food....really cool spot
RECORD SHOPPING
*Jazzy Sport ( 3­17­7 Meguro Gohongi) – about 3­4 stops from Shibuya station and has a great selection...lots of dope Japanese mixes & productions by Mitsu,Budamunk,Gagle,Grooveman Spot,etc...plus has some great records. Gaku is the manager. Awesome cafe about two blocks down the road for a coffee and cool clothing store next door.
*Disk Union Shibuya,Shinjuku & Kichijoji – all stores are different and have various selections in hip hop,boogie,funk,soul,disco,house. Try and get out to all of them...some killer dollar bin jams. *Yellow Pop, Flash Disc Ranch, Disk Union & Jetset in Shimokitazawa (great area like Brunswick and about 4 stops from Shibuya on Keio train line from Shibuya station)
*Lighthouse Records – Shibuya (Dogenzaka, Shibuya­ku) – amazing selection of music. *Coconut discs Tokyo
OTHER SHIT
*Go to Bic Camera and get a data card for your phone. Cheap, 4gig and easy to set up *Shimokitazawa is a dope suburb.. Well worth checking.
*Inokashira Park in Kichijoji. Has a lake you can hire wee paddle boats in..
*Kabukichō at night. It's basically Tokyo's red light/entertainment district. It's Yakuza central. But it's safe. It's good for a wander to check out all the weird and fun shops.. Got some nice restaurants there too.. Very interesting and entertaining place.
*If you are in Tokyo on a Sunday you can do absolutely NO better than going to Harajuku and spending the day in Yoyogi park.
*Only ATMs in 7­11 will take foreign credit cards
*DO NOT go to Robot Restaurant.. Waste of time and money.
*Kansai – cool shopping and culture
*Yanaka (suburb of Tokyo with old architecture)
*Get a rail pass from one of the stations.. Like a myki, saves getting single fares all the time, works on buses etc as well.

Ride a go­kart around Tokyo dressed as Mario
What? What the actual what! Yep. You can drive a go­kart around the real streets of central Tokyo dressed in a ridiculous costume. It’s all a little bit terrifying, at first. Driving a go­kart on busy Tokyo streets, while wearing a red Mario cap instead of a helmet is totally safe, right?
But the nerves go, and it’s pretty much the best thing you’ve ever done. Ever. I went on the night drive, and people on the streets wave at you and take photos as if you’re a celebrity. So it’s perfect if you’re yet to experience your 15 minutes of fame.
Mario­karting costs about AUD$80 for 2 hrs, and you’ll be in a group, led by a driver at the front, and one at the back. You'll generally be going about 30km p/h, but I reached up to 50 at times, which gets the adrenalin going big time.
http://maricar.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtrre9WL51Q Go extrasensory at Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku
Robot Restaurant is basically a cabaret theater restaurant, with a robot theme. Admittedly, it’s pretty touristy, like “let’s go and watch wacky Japan things”, but it really is ridiculously fun. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so much concentrated happiness in a 90­minute time slot in my life.
You’ll see crazy costumes to rival the best cosplay, giant robot pandas and dinosaurs, performers suspended from the roof playing drums, and all kinds of colourful shenanigans. There’s so much crazy awesome shit going on you don’t know where to look.
Don’t bother with the meal, just get the show ticket. You can get snacks and booze during the show anyway. Tickets are slightly cheaper if you get them online. Book a few days in advance so you don’t miss out.
Visit a Harry Hedgehog Cafe for cuteness overload
You’ve probably heard of cat cafes, but in Japan you can also hang out with a plethora of other beasties, like goats, rabbits, owls and hedgehogs. Best to avoid the ones where the animals aren’t domesticated though (the owl cafe left me feeling pretty uneasy).
In Japan, Hedgehogs are the equivalent to having a guinea­pig; you can easily buy them from pet stores. Here, in Australia, hedgehogs aren’t native and weren’t introduced. Because they
  
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
aren’t creatures you come across, it’s awesome to spend some time with these cutie­pies at Harry Hedgehog Cafe in Roppongi, to find out what their like.
Hedgehogs are super tiny and you can hold them in the palm of your hands. They like snorting, burrowing and eating mealworms. They don’t feel as spiky as you might imagine, more like running your hands over a bristly brush. Visiting a hedgehog Cafe is a pretty nice way to spend an afternoon.

Getting to/From the Airport
The best way to get to and from the airport is the Narita Express (NEX). It takes about an hour on a really comfortable train. You’ll arrive at Tokyo Station ­ from here you’ll need to taxi or subway to where you’re staying. Round trip tickets are really cheap for tourists (4000 yen return). When you exit customs at the airport simply take the stairs or escalators to the basement and find the JR ticket office. You’ll need your passport to buy the tickets. http://www.japan­guide.com/e/e2359_nex.html
Note that you can reserve tickets for the return train, but it’s not necessary. The easiest thing is to just jump on the first NEX train and find an empty seat. All you need is your original ticket.
Cash is King
Note that only big stores and proper restaurants accept credit cards. I highly advise you to have cash on hand. The best thing is to get cash at the airport upon arrival ­ there are a few ATM’s once you exit customs. We had trouble finding ATM’s that accepted our credit cards once we got into town.
Getting Around
The metro system is great ­ just like in other big cities like London. You should all get a Suica card each which are preloaded cards that work for all public transport (kind of like the Oyster cards in London). I gave Heugh and Sue our ones. You and Gerald can buy yours along with the NEX tickets at the JR ticket office at the airport.
Make sure you research which exit to use at each station you’re going to. These subway/train stations are MASSIVE and if you get out the wrong exit you’ll easily get lost.
PS! A great smart phone app for navigating the metro system: Tokyo Rail Map Lite. Between that and Google Maps (turn your roaming off!) you should be able to get around.
Places to go
You guys don’t have a lot of time so I’m assuming you just want to chill, take in the atmosphere and eat some good food. My recommendations are:
     
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Shibuya is by far the coolest and most happening suburb and it’s where we prefer to stay. Shibuya crossing is famous from the movie Lost In Translation. From here you can shop till you drop at cheap and good stores like Loft and Tokyo Hands (cool Japanese knick knacks) or UNIQLO or Muji (clothes). Google them in advance to save yourself a world of trouble.
Piss Alley is our favourite little food alley in Tokyo ­ some images below.
http://www.tofugu.com/2012/11/23/tokyos­infamous­piss­alley/
Piss Alley was the inspiration for the noodle eating scenes in the movie Blade Runner. It’s in Shinjuku which is the next suburb on from Shibuya (another very busy and happening suburb that’s worth a visit). Piss Alley itself is a bit hard to find just north of the train station so I’m attaching a Google Map link.
Tokyo Fish Market (Tsukiji) ­ this place is awesome! If you’re seriously jet lagged you could try to get into the tuna auctions at 5am, but otherwise go after 9am, stroll around and see the most amazing array of sea food you’ve EVER seen. Then go and have the freshest sashimi you’ve ever had for breakfast. A must!
http://www.japan­guide.com/e/e3021.html
Where to eat
Food doesn’t have to be expensive to be good in Tokyo. Izakaya’s (tiny bar/eateries) are recognisable by the red lanterns hanging outside and are a MUST. They cook teppanyaki skewers on hot coals in front of you while you and Japanese business men get drunk on beer and sake. Note that they all serve a lot of offal, so be careful what you choose :­)
Otherwise any kind of ramen noodles place is recommended ­ cheap and cheerful. And if you want something nice, find yourself a cosy looking restaurant and have a more familiar “Kura Restaurant” experience, but it will be a bit more pricey.
Note: The best food places are often down the backstreets and behind the big buildings. You won’t get mugged in Tokyo ­ stealing from or harming westerners is a serious no­on in Japanese culture. You may even find the ryokan you’re staying at won’t have locks on the doors... Ours didn’t.
Shopping/opening hours
Shopping is great with massive malls. I would recommend Shibuya if you’re serious about shopping. North and northwest of Shibuya Crossing you’ll find an array of massive malls like Parco and all the usual big chains like Zara, Adidas, etc. Like all big Asian cities, most thing don’t really open until 11am. Going out at 7­8am in search for breakfast and coffee??? Good luck with that... But in return everything is open super late.
Tips by: Bria Baker
Don’t travel in Summer unless you can really cope with heat. Spring and Autumn are definitely the best time to visit.
       
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Have maps prepared of your locations/accommodations to take with you or organise a mobile phone with sim/gps coverage at the airport. Most of Japan does not have address or street names and you will struggle to find places. Taxi drivers normally expect to be handed a map. Especially in Tokyo.
You can eat generally cheaply if you want and save money. 7/11, convenience stores (like Lawsons) and the basement floors of all department stores actually have very good food.
Also to save money consider staying at some Japanese guest houses or book via Japanese websites. Western Hotels are much more expensive due to the English speaking staff and western beds etc. use a site like https://japaneseguesthouses.com/ http://japaneseinngroup.com to find accommodation they range from very fancy to reasonable
Don’t do tours, investigate the tours online and then just copy the itineraries and do them yourself, they are a huge cost and just aimed at people too nervous to find their way around or communicate. You can always find a way to make yourself understood.
If you get lost, don’t panic and get loud, best not to ask someone for help (unless you speak some Japanese) or ask loudly for someone who can speak English, you will just make people nervous and they will avoid you. Stand still, look obviously confused, look around you, look at your phone and or map. Within minutes someone will approach you and offer you help and most likely walk you to your destination.
Don’t automatically accept your travel agent’s word that the Japan Rail pass is the best deal. If you are only going to a couple of locations or you are going to Japan for a long trip sometimes the pass is not the best option, especially if you will be going into the mountains, taking buses or local trains (cheap). Look up all your train trips here and you can see the exact costs and route times and calculate whether the pass will save you money. Also consider the West or East Pass if you are only going to a certain area of Japan as they are cheaper. The rail pass is only best if you are going to several major cities over a short time.
Recommended Locations
Tokyo
Go to Harajuku, Yogogi park and the Meiji Shrine on the weekend if you want to see young people dressed in CosPlay and performing in the park.
Golden gai small bars in Shinjuku is a must see
Omoide Yokocho where the salary workers eat after work (behind the train tracks) is also a must see
If you like museums the Edo museum is a good one. Ueno park nearby is good for cherry blossoms in the Spring.
Senso­Ji is a great temple, the market is a bit tacky but the food stalls are good.
  
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
Ginza (the most expensive area of Tokyo) on the weekend when the main street is closed off is a good day to visit. I recommend getting lunch or cake at the famous Shiseido Parlour or at least going to their gift store and buying some of their famous chocolates or cheesecake
Disney Land is actually excellent (and considered the best Disney in the world) but you need to go midweek and use the fast pass or you will spend all day in queues. I prefer Disney sea (there are two sides of the park) for the Jules Verne Steam Punk world and the little Venice but if you are going with children the standard Disneyland side is probably better. There are some obsessed Disney bloggers so you can easily research whether it is your thing and which attractions or side of the park you should plan your day around.
Akihabara (Electric town) is not that much cheaper for games etc and I would really only recommend for die hard geeks or a quick look. If you want to see people dressed up in costume etc again you need to visit on the weekend. This is where the Maid Cafes are if you want to check that out. If you want the female version google Butler Café (female guests served by men) and visit one of those (I have visited one in Harajuku but there are probably a few about)
Themed restaurants are very popular and are a fun thing to do in Tokyo. The Robot restaurant is the newest most popular one, other ones you can check out would be Alice in Wonder, Ninja, Asylum. I recommend The LockUp but google Tokyo theme restaurant and you will find heaps of theme.
Shibuya and Shinjku are the best locations to stay if you want to be in the “heart” of the action of Tokyo. If you want to be in the traditional edo area and stay in a traditional guest house your best bet is Asakusa or Ueno. Wherever you stay I recommend checking the nearest train station – it is best if you are near a station that is hub or near a hub that links to multiple exchanges across Tokyo. Check the subway map of Tokyo – you want to be near a station that has a thick black ring around it as these are the stops where you can switch subway lines.

The best view in Tokyo and the best deal for budget travels is probably the Tokyo Youth Hostel in the central Tokyo. The bath is also amazing: http://www.jyh.gr.jp/tcyh/e/top.html
The best deal on the most traditional accommodation in Tokyo is probably Homeikan (Classic building) . Not in central Tokyo but a quiet district and near 4 train lines. http://www.homeikan.com/en/en_welcome.html
My favourite location in Tokyo is Shimokitazawa for great fashion, cafes, second hand shops. If you don’t mind traveling out of the way and you want to do Airbnb this is where I would look to stay. If not try and make time to visit this neighbourhood.
Get a Suica card at the airport when you arrive. It is basically a MYKI card and will let you travel across the Tokyo subway more easily.
The Disk Union record stores around Tokyo are excellent.
Tokyo Hands is a great store for buying kitchen, household goods, cosmetics, gifts etc.

Day trips from Tokyo
Nikko is amazing and can be done in a day or overnight trip from Tokyo
Kamakura can be down in a day/overnight if you want to see shrines and if you aren’t going to somewhere like Kyoto.
Kawagoe – short 30 minute train ride to see a traditional historic town.
Hakone – overnight if you want to see views of Mount Fuji and do hot springs.
Kiso valley/ Nakasendo way
Mountain walk that follows the original edo samurai postal route between two traditional preserved village. Start in one town hike the trail and stay in a traditional ryokan guesthouse at the other end. At certain times of year you can get your luggage shipped from the station to your accommodation at the end of the trail otherwise check in at your hotel, leave you luggage and then catch the train to the end of the route and walk your way back.
http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/rtg/pdf/pg­408.pdf http://www.japanvisitor.com/japan­city­guides/kiso­valley­guide Takayama
Amazing mountain village with traditional shops and regional dishes including Hida Steak which some say is better than Kobe and mountain vegetables. Lots of tourist attractions – old samurai houses, markets, temples, hotsprings. You want at least two days here.
Kamikochi
Remote hiking location around lake in the mountains. Easy walking but some of the most amazing scenery in Japan, especially in Autumn. You can stay in the resorts but they are very expensive, I recommend going for the day, hiking and then catching the bus to a nearby mountain onsen like Shirahone or Hirayu. You can leave yours bags at the information centre.
Shirakawa­go
Visit and stay in a traditional Japanese farm village. Very busy during the day and flooded with tourists but nice in the evenings when they leave. Recommended staying the night in one of the traditional thatched homes and eating traditional dinner over the fire and then exploring the village in the morning before the tourists arrive.
Kanazawa (little Kyoto)
Stay in the main street in the teahouse district in a 200 year old geisha house – Yogetsu book in advance. You may need someone who speaks Japanese to ring and book for you but it will be worth it.
Iga
Little village that is a great day trip(couple of hours there but it takes a while to get there by train) if you are interested in Ninja. There is a ninja house (Iga ryu Ninja house) here where you get a
  
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
tour and they demonstrate hidden walls and floors and how ninja moved and hide around the house and castles back in the day. There is also a little castle.
Kyoto
Accommodation is expensive in Kyoto – unless you want to spend up big you may need to sacrifice or compromise and either stay in a modern budget type hotel (book way in advance) or look at traditional B and B style however expect that while the building will be beautiful the room will be small and walls will literally be made out of paper and you will hear your neighbours every word and snore! However often these places have free bikes, computers/wifi and friendly travellers so I recommend. I would look to stay in a Machiya which is a traditional wood house commonly found in Kyoto.
http://www.kyoto­machiya­inn.com/accommodations/
Nara
Close to Kyoto and worth visiting for shines, Buddha and deer park
Yoshino
If near Kyoto and Nara this is a must see if it is Cherry Blossom season and the trees are in bloom. Entire mountain side covered with blossom.
Mount Koya
One of the best places to visit if you want to visit an active Buddhist temple (you can stay and participate if that is your thing). However if you aren’t in the area there are plenty of beautiful Buddhist temples and I recommend searching wherever you are going as there may be a nearby temple you can visit.
Osaka
Amazing food district and neon lights – very Blade Runner.
Amerika Town – worth a visit for seeing hot rod cars, 50s American Japan clothes and souvenirs Universal Studios – good amusement park, replica of the one in the US with Jaws ride etc Osaka is home of Japan’s bunraku puppetry. If you like the arts I would recommend seeing a show at the National Bunraku Theatre they are normally based on Japanese folk stories and have stage surtitles or headphones with English translations.
Himeji Castle
One of the most impressive castles in Japan. This is located between Osaka/Kyoto and Hiroshima on the shinkansen train so you can just jump off the train and make a stop in Himeji go visit the castle for a couple of hours and then jump back on the train and continue your trip. Definitely worth the diversion. Nothing else worth visiting in Himeji.
Okayama
The international villa groups offers incredible rates for international travels to experience staying in traditional Japanese accommodation and see Japan rural life in Okayama. Locations are out of the way (local buses) and far from anything but the destinations and buildings are
 
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
amazing. I have stayed at the Hattoji Villa (traditional thatched roof) which was where the film Black Rain was filmed. website and booking methods are rudimentary but it is dirt cheap ($40 a night) and experience is unique for those who want to see life away from the city. http://international­villa.or.jp/en/
Kurashiki
Lovely historic city in Okayama with canals and artsy shops, boutiques, cafes. You can jump off the train here and spend a lovely couple of hours.
Korakuen Garden
Is one of the three great gardens of Japan and worth a look if you like traditional Japanese gardens. In Okayama.
Hiroshima
Peace memorial museum and Atomic Bomb dome
Shukkei­en garden
Miyajima Island (floating red tori and floating temple, deer, restaurants, café, street food, hiking)
Fukuoka
Good connecting city for the south island but good for southern regional food, I wouldn’t than spend longer than a day or evening here before exploring Kyushu in the South.
Yufuin no Mori
One of the most picturesque scenic train rides in Japan in an art deco style train with floor to ceiling glass windows. Make sure you get a seat in the front carriage with the driver (book in advance). The train takes across the beautiful countryside through mountains to the boutique town of Yufuin.
Yufuin
Hotsprings lakeside town, many outdoor and indoor hotspring spas and art and craft stores, museums, cafes. Popular Japanese holiday destination.
Yonohira
Tiny town near Yufuin. There is almost nothing in this tiny town and they barely get any western tourists. The town is so narrow with cobblestone streets that cars can not fit in the main street so you need to trek from the station or take a taxi that will drop you off next to the village. HOWEVER, it’s romantic and lovely and there is beautiful onsen including one in a cave (if you can stand the temperature!)
I stayed at the Yamahsiroya traditional guesthouse which used to be the postoffice. The grandfather was once a famous actor/opera singer I think and the house is decorated with film memorabilia. The family will take very good care of you (the entire family actually drove us to our next destination after we checked out)and the private outdoor bath is amazing. You should
 
 The Super Tips Master Guide Edition II 30 November 2016
get the meal wherever you stay as the town does not have many dining options apart from lunch cafes. http://www.e­yamashiroya.jp/
Mount Aso
Live volcano you can visit (if conditions are okay you can go to the crater).
Kurokawa Onsen
Exclusive onsen town located in the mountains by a spring. You can only get here by bus (or hire a car/taxi). The entire village is made up of outdoor hotsprings and exclusive spa/guesthouses. You can stay at one guesthouse and spend all day visiting all the different hotspring, each have different kind of natural spring waters. Highly recommended if you can afford it.
http://www.kurokawaonsen.or.jp/eng_new
Beppu
Old seaside town, quite run down but picturesque – where they filmed James Bond – You Only Live Twice. You can see mud baths here and colourful bubbling hot spring, geysers (hells of Beppu)
Beppu offers sand baths where you get buried in hot volcanic sand either on the beach or at one of the hotsprings or spas – especially recommend the Takegawara bathhouse which first opened in 1879 and is still running.
